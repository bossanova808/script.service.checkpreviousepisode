Kodi Check Previous Episode
===================================

script.service.checkpreviousepisode

Kodi script to prevent accidental spoilers by checking the episode (in the Kodi library) prior to the one you are starting to watch, to make sure you have watched it.

You can mark shows where episode order doesn't matter as show to be ignored (and unmark them in the addon settings), and if you're in the habit of e.g. deleting seasons you have watched, you can force it to only check when the prior epsiode is actually in your library.

If it detects you've started playback of an episode you probably shouldn't have, the video will be paused, and you'll get a pop up window with options to stop playback, carry on on this occasion, or carry on and also mark the show as one to ignore from now on.
